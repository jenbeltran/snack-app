			<h2>About this App</h2>
			<h5>Welcome to my Snack Project!</h5>

			<p>
				I'm Jen Beltran and I'm a Full Stack Web Development Student at York University (expected graduation
				November 2019).
			</p>
			<p>I built this app to showcase my knowledge from design to deployment.</p>

			<p>I'm a big foodie and I love snacks. I'm always on the hunt for new cool snacks to try. </p>
			<p>Pick My Snack is a web application that connects snacks enthusiasts together.</p>
			<p>Users can add snacks, buy snacks, rate snacks, and even add snacks to their favourites page.</p>

			<p>Development stack used: React, Express, Node, NextJS, MySQL</p>

			<p>***The deployment of this app is simply for project showcasing purposes, not for public use***</p>
