# snack-app

Welcome to my personal project!

Pick My Snack is a web application that connects snacks enthusiasts together.

Users can add snacks, buy snacks (via QR code), and select favourites.

Development stack used: React, Express, Node, NextJS, MySQL (local db)

Please note this app is simply for learning purposes, not for public use.

I don't own rights or ownership to any uploaded photos.

To open application:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Since MySQL is local, please connect your MySQL keys in the .envExample file
Snacks that I've used are in the database/snacks.sql file
